## ℹ️ Introduction

This is a Python project application template using Flask and FastAPI in a **WSL container**

> [Direct Link to the Setup page](https://nicojane.github.io/PY-Flask-FastApi-Template-WSL-Stack/Howtos/Setup)

## ✅ Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- WSL 2.6.1.0
- Powershell 5.1 or 7.3

This is a Python Flask application (template) that requires the following libraries (installed with pip via the requirements file):

1. Flask: A web framework for Python.
2. Redis: An in-memory data structure store, used as a database.
3. Jinja2: A modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python.
4. PDB: Python Debugger, used for debugging the Flask application.

The template includes a basic structure for a web application using FastAPI and Flask, with support for Redis as a database and Jinja2 for templating. PDB is provided for debugging purposes during development.
After installation your project is in the Debian WSL distribution, use VS Code to develop it there.

<small> Note: There is also a Docker version of this project template available. However, due to remote debugging issues in the Docker container, it is recommended to use this non-Docker version. The Docker container can be found: [here](https://github.com/NicoJanE/PY-Flask-FastApi-Template-Stack) </small>
