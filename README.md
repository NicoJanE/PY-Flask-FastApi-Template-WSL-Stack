## ℹ️ Introduction

This is a Python project application template using Flask and FastAPI in a **WSL container**

> [Direct Link to the Setup page](https://nicojane.github.io/PY-Flask-FastApi-Template-WSL-Stack/Howtos/Setup)

## ✅ Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11
- WSL 2.6.1.0
- Powershell 5.1 or 7.3

This is a Python Flask application (template) that requires the following libraries (installed with pip via the requirements file):

1. Flask: A web framework for Python.
2. Redis: An in-memory data structure store, used as a database.
3. Jinja2: A modern and designer-friendly templating language for Python.
4. PDB: Python Debugger, used for debugging the Flask application.

The template includes a basic structure for a web application using FastAPI and Flask, with support for Redis as a database and Jinja2 for templating. PDB is provided for debugging purposes during development.
After installation your project is in the Debian WSL distribution, use VS Code to develop it there.

Note: There is also a Docker version of this project template available. However, due to remote debugging issues in the Docker container, it is recommended to use this non-Docker version. The Docker container can be found: [here](https://github.com/NicoJanE/PY-Flask-FastApi-Template-Stack)
